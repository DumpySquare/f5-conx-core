# Introduction

The F5 SDK (JS) provides client libraries to access various F5 products and services. It focuses primarily on facilitating consuming our most popular APIs and services, currently including BIG-IP (via Automation Tool Chain) and F5 Cloud Services.

Benefits:

- Provides hand-written or auto-generated client code to make F5â€™s APIs/services simple and intuitive to use.
- Handles the low-level details of communication with the API or service, including authentication sessions, async task handling, protocol handling, large file uploads, and more.
- Can be installed using familiar package management tools such as npm.

## Usage

Basic Example:
```javascript
const ManagementClient = require('f5-sdk-js').bigip.ManagementClient;
const AS3Client = require('f5-sdk-js').bigip.extension.AS3Client;

const mgmtClient = new ManagementClient({
    host: '192.0.2.1',
    port: 443,
    user: 'admin',
    password: 'admin'
})
await mgmtClient.login();

const extensionClient = new AS3Client(mgmtClient);
await extensionClient.service.create({ config: {} });
```

Typescript Import Example:
```typescript
import { bigip } from 'f5-sdk-js';

const ManagementClient = bigip.ManagementClient;
const AS3Client = bigip.extension.AS3Client;
```

## Contributor Documentation

A collection of helpful commands have been added to the package manager (npm) scripts directive. Check out the `package.json` for an up-to-date list of commands. 

- Build Package (Typescript -> Javascript): `npm run build-package`
- Build Code Documentation: `npm run build-code-docs`
- Run Unit Tests: `npm run test`
- Run Linter: `npm run lint`

Note that the `main` and `types` package manager directive are pointed at the `dist` folder (where `tsc` builds the package). Please ensure any published packages builds and includes that folder.
